    *How-To-Use*
    ------------
     On runtime, a welcome board will appear infront of the player to read their objectives and
     how to play the game.

     To move around, use the 'W' and 'S' Keys to move forward and backwards, to move left and right,
     use the 'A' and 'D' keys, respectively. Using the cursor will move you the camera around. 

     To toggle tactical vision use either the 'V' key or the button in the top right. To use the
     button first press 'TAB'. When looking throug your tactical vision, datashards are highlighted
     orange, buttons highlighted blue and pathways are highlighted red.

     To use the buttons on the welcome board, press 'TAB' to pause the game and drag your cursor
     to either button to restart the game or exit.

     The objective is to find the 15 shards located around the map, so walking into them will add
     them to your count. To access some you may need to open up a pathway. To do this find the
     nearby button, shown in blue on your tactical vision, to locate them and use 'Right-mouse click'
     to activate them.

     *WARNING* Terminating the console will lose process made in the session and removing any,
               files from the release folder could potentially break the program.
